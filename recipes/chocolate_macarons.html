    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 egg whites</li>
            <li>1/2 cup (100g) granulated sugar</li>
            <li>3/4 cup (70g) almond flour</li>
            <li>3/4 cup (90g) powdered sugar</li>
            <li>1/4 cup (30g) cocoa powder</li>
            <li>salt</li>
            <li>cream and chocolate for the ganache (very small quantities)</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Beat the egg whites until fluffy, then beat in the granulated sugar until the mixture is glossy and you get floppy peaks. Put in the almond flour, powdered sugar, cocoa powder, and a few grains of salt. Fold the dry ingredients into the eggs until you get a mousse-like consistency.</li>
            <li>Cover a sheet pan with parchment paper and spoon the batter on in about 20 dollops. Let them sit and dry for a half hour. Heat the oven to 350 F / 180 C and bake until the meringues start to crack, about 15 minutes. Cool completely before filling.</li>
            <li>To make the ganache, combine as little as 2 tbsp of cream with an equal quantity of chocolate by volume. Microwave until just bubbling, let it sit for a minute, then stir until smooth. Cool the ganache down to get it to a spreadable consistency.</li>
        </ol>
